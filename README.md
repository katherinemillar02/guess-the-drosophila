# Guess the Drosophila quiz 

 version 1 


Still to fix: 
- Don't allow user to see the answer before submitting 
- Give an overall of the persons score at the end 
- Maybe change some of the titles
- i have used the reactive() function to an extent but want to use it more?? 

OPEN TO ANYMORE FEEDBACK

observe()
part of reactiveValues()
- chapter 16 in Mastering shiny 
- can change reactive values?
