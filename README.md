#### Still to fix: 
- Don't allow user to see the answer before submitting 
- Give an overall of the persons score at the end 
- Maybe change some of the titles
- I have used the reactive() function to an extent but want to use it more?? 
- Use observe() part of reactiveValues()
- Chapter 16 in Mastering shiny 
- Can change reactive values?
